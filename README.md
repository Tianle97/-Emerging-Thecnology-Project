#### Lecturer: *Ian McLoughlin*
#### Student Name: *Tianle Shu*
#### Student ID: *G00341565*
## *Introduction*
The project involves writing documentation, code, and comments in the programming language Python [2] and using the Jupyter notebook [5] software. </br>
There are 4 Jupyter notebook and 1 Pthon Script.
+ numpy random notebook
+ Iris dataset notebook
+ MNIST dataset notebook
+ Digit recognition script
+ Digit recognition notebook

## *Explain the rquirements about this project*
<br/>
### numpy random notebook
a jupyter notebook explaining the con- cepts behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots of the various distributions. <br/>
### Iris dataset notebook
a jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset. <br/>
### MNIST dataset notebook
a jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python. <br/>
### Digit recognition script
a Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a super- vised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset. <br/>
### Digit recognition notebook
a jupyter notebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance. <br/>

    "#### What is MNIST?\n",
    "MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a sub data set of NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology), a large database of handwritten digits. MNIST is used to train image processing systems and is basically the \"hello world\" of machine learning and computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Training images are used to train a system, and testing images are used to test the trained system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where does the MNIST dataset come from?\n",
    "The set of images in the MNIST database is a combination of two of NIST's databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 consist of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Tensorflow and Keras?\n",
    "Tensorflow is a popular software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. Tensorflow is open-source and is developed by the Google Brain Team. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library and is also used for machine learning applications such as neaural networks. I will be using Tensorflow's Python API but it is available for a range of languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python developed by a Google engineer: Francois Chollet. Keras acts like a \"library on top of a library\" as it is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. Keras takes the functionality in core Tensorflow and adds a higher-level of abstraction to it, making it easier to experiment with deep neural networks."
